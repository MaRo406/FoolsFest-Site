    "text": "What is provided at FoolsFest?\nCamping space: A campsite where you can pitch a tent, hang a hammock, or park a vehicle to sleep in under the shade of beautiful California live oak trees! There are potable water spigots throughout Live Oak Campground and plenty of space, so feel free to spread out and build up. We will have “greeters” to help you find a spot and orient you to the campground when you arrive. \nRestrooms: The campground’s bathrooms are within a few minutes’ walk from your campsite, with running water, flush toilets, sinks, and showers. The showers are communal style, separated by genders - think gym locker room vibes, with many shower heads in one big open room.\nKitchen: An industrial kitchen is on-site, with a walk-in fridge, sinks, stoves, and greywater disposal. The industrial kitchen will primarily be available for those preparing food and beverage-related contributions for FoolsFest (see below), so please plan to store and prepare all personal food at your campsite, using your own cooking gear. There are no fires allowed in the campground, except for in the fire ring by the kitchen; feel free to roast your weenies there.\nElectricity: There are outlets at all the buildings at Live Oak, plus in a few other scattered power boxes. If you want power outside of common spaces, we recommend bringing portable battery packs. Extension cords are technically not allowed at Live Oak."

Other helpful items to put on your packing list: a headlamp, a silly hat, a yoga mat, first aid kit, earplugs, sunscreen, shower sandals, a portable chair, warm layers, and your sense of foolish fun!"

If you bring garbage or packaging we ask that you plan to pack it out when you leave, as we have limited space for trash and recycling after the event. Help by bringing reusable eating utensils, plates, cups, and cloth napkins, and by removing products from packaging and cardboard boxes before coming. Water is available on site so no need for single use plastic water bottles – bring your reusable water bottles!"

    "text": "How much do tickets cost?\nWe are not selling tickets for FoolsFest. The shared costs of Foolsfest, such as the cost of the venue rental, are covered thanks to our generous sponsor – Eden Foundation II.  We hope this encourages you to invest your time, love, creativity, and other resources into making FoolsFest a spectacle of joyful expression. \nIf a monetary donation is still something you are excited to contribute, please let us know. \nWhen and where should we plan to arrive? And is it possible to come just for the day or do I have to stay overnight?\nWe have the entire campground rented out from Thursday, April 24 28 - Sunday, April  27. All are welcome to come and go whenever they please. Thursday is the setup day and if you’d like to come then to help out, please let Erin or Mateo know (or just show up)! On Sunday we’ll do an all-hands-on-deck cleanup, so please plan to help clean up before leaving.\nThere’s no requirement to stay overnight, though many thrills, skills, and frills will only be revealed after dark ;) If you would prefer to stay in other accommodations, Santa Barbara or Santa Ynez are each about a 20-30 minute drive away."

    "section": "How can I contribute to FoolsFest?",
    "text": "How can I contribute to FoolsFest?\nThere are many ways to contribute to FoolsFest! As a DIY co-created campout, this event is like a blank canvas for you to fill in with your preferred color of paint (or painted body part). There are three primary ways to contribute:\n1) Share your passion! FoolsFest is a co-created experience, made entirely by us fools! If you’re someone who has a skill or passion you’d like to share, we’d love to hear about it. You could play music, dance, share a skill, lead a movement class, do some art, give a talk, put on a workshop, prepare food or drink to share, plan a game, and so much more - the sky’s the limit! Any and all forms of silliness and creativity are encouraged. \n2) Volunteer! FoolsFest is only happening because YOU will help make it happen. We’ll be gathering interest in specific volunteering duties, but we’re counting on you to pitch in when you see something that needs to be done. Is there trash on the ground? Pick it up. See someone struggling to put up a tent? Pitch in and give them a hand. Someone cooked you dinner? Clean the dishes!\n3) Participate! Ultimately, this event is about showing up and just being present :) Enjoy and appreciate our time together, and the things other people are bringing! Get to know your fellow fools! Lend a hand! Tell a joke! Accept a gift! Learn a skill! Dance a jig! Explore Live Oak! Wear a costume! Participation can mean so many things, whether quiet or expressive, both behind-the-scenes and out front. We’re so excited to get foolish together!"

People and events will be spread out around the campground, so it will be rare that all participants will be doing the same thing at the same time. Everyone should plan to take care of their own needs."

An industrial kitchen will be available for food and beverage-related contributions open to the FoolsFest community, a Public House will be available for events: skillshares, workshops, tavern takeovers or any other event-like contributions, and stages will be available for dance, performance, or music-related contributions. There is also a TON of open, free space throughout the campground - be creative, and use whatever space you’d like!\nReach out to Mateo or Erin to let us know what type of contribution you’ll be providing, and where you’d ideally like to set it up.  Spur-of-the-moment contributions are also welcomed and there will be a central message board where you can post last minute additions to FoolsFest."
